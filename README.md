# potatOS

**potatOS** is a hobby operating system built from scratch as a learning-focused and experimental project.

The goal of potatOS is not to be practical or production-ready, but to deeply understand how operating systems work internally — from early boot stages to kernel subsystems — by implementing things manually and documenting the process along the way.

This project exists as a personal playground for low-level exploration, mistakes, experiments, and learning through building.

## Documentation & Build Journal

potatOS has a dedicated documentation site that acts as both a technical reference and a development journal.
Each step of the build process is documented clearly and incrementally, making it easy to follow the system’s evolution over time.
